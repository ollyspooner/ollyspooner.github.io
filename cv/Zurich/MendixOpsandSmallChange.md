# Mendix Operations and Small Change Manager

## Any Mendix low-code or other low-code platform experience

* I have a Mendix Advanced Developer certification.
* I have been using Mendix since 2017, when version 7 had just been released.
* Prior to that I had been developing solutions for SharePoint using SharePoint 2013 Workflows and JavaScript.
* Power Platform (Power Apps, Power Automate & Power Query).

## Experience of working in an Agile environment

* We started using Agile Scrum formally when we began our first Mendix project.
* We have since adapted our approach as our team size and composition has changed.

## Knowledge of DevOps and Cloud concepts

* Although we mainly use the Mendix (AWS + Cloud Foundry) hosting solution, we have experimented with other options:
  * Local Mendix server (on a VM)
  * Docker Compose based test environments with automatic build and deploy for each active feature branch. This used DockerHub to host images and the Mendix Docker Buildpack. Environments were hosted on an on-prem server fronted by an NGINX layer and automatic SSL certificate issuing from LetsEncrypt (Certbot).
* This was before Git version control was available. I think there would be better options to streamline the pipeline now.

## Experience in people management

* I have been managing a team of between 3 and 5 for the last 3 years.
* Find opportunities to develop new skills within the team.
* Reserve time for personal development and encourage team members to use it.
* Allow experimentation and "blue-sky" ideas that may lead to improved solutions.
* Performance management: focus on setting realistic timeframes rather than over promising and then rushing or under delivering.
* I was presented with dissatisfaction with a lack of career progression in one of my direct reports. This is a common situation in a smaller organisation as there is a limited amount of room to progress. It took a while, but I managed to negotiate a change to the data team and she now line manages an assistant and is taking the lead on the data warehouse and migration.

## Experienced in translating business demand into requirements

* Have been involved in every app requirement capture session.
* I have been running story and issue definition and refinement sessions for the last 3 years
* Have taken the lead in steering the architectural decisions for the last 5 years.
* Have collaborated with more experienced business analyists to map out and optimise complex processes.

## Experience in managing competing demands, from demanding stakeholders in a frenetic environment

* As a small team, we are constantly balancing maintenance of current apps in production with new apps and features, accross a range of stakeholders.
* With no consistent common point of authority between all apps, we are often left to decide priorities and negotiate with stakeholders.

## Have some software development experience

* JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, PowerShell, SQL, Java, XML, XSLT
* XProc, C#, Python

## Great interpersonal skills, and good written and oral communication skills â€“ being able to talk directly to customers to understand requirements

* I enjoy meeting and working with people.
* While I don't seek conflict, I also will voice my opinions where appropriate.
* I am genuinely interested in learning what people do and how things work.
* I can visualise processes and then re-present them to allow others to understand them.
* I have had to write project briefs and justifications in the past.
* I have resolved issues with a wide range of users: staff, volunteers and donors.

## Enjoy problem solving and think logically

* I can work around problems and know how to research and get help if I need to learn a new skill.
(CRM integration)

## Work collaboratively with the business to turn ambiguity into requirements

* I have led my team to work iteratively to increase understanding of issues as the project evolves.
(Supply Chain)

## Contribute to working in a diverse team with different backgrounds and skills

* Having worked as a lone I.T. person, I greatly appreciate working with others who have different skill sets and viewpoints.
(Carter: TypeScript/Sam: AI)

## Take responsibility for a piece of work from start to finish

* As Development Manager, I am the one who has to explain anything missing, late or not working.
* We use release management features (Jira) to communicate what has been delivered in each release.

## Enjoy providing a supportive environment to growing people and a team to deliver first-class operational and development support

* As a Manager, I strongly believe that a large part of my role is to support those around me, as well as to provide a high quality
