# Olly Spooner - **Cover Letter (Kensa)**

Dear Recruitment Team,
Having been a Kensa customer via the Heat the Streets project, I was greatly interested to hear of the role of Business Systems Analyst. I am confident that my experience in simplifying, improving and integrating business processes and workflows would make me a great fit for your future projects.

To me, Kensa is an exciting group to be involved with both for the technology and due to its local origins. Given the current climate emergency, I am also very keen to see both the sector and Kensa specifically continue to succeed and help to deliver us a more sustainable future.

On a more personal level, I worked with Stuart Parker at ShelterBox for several years and feel that we share common views. My wife, Vicki, has also worked with Kensa via the Stithians Energy Group.

Thank you for your consideration,
Olly Spooner
