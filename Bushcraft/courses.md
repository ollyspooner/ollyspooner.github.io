## "Fire starter" or Build and light a fire to cook dampers and a hot drink

    Learn how to make fire safely in the wild, and then get the kettle on!

    We will start by learning about and finding fuel (let's be honest, it's mostly wood), then we will explore some different methods to get the fire lit.
    While the fire gets established, we will contruct a device to hang our kettle on so that we can finish with a satisfying brew and toast some tasty snacks!

This one is pretty much good to go and can be done in a wide range of places.

## Trainee fire god

    So you can light a fire? Let's take away the matches ...
    ... and the firelighters ...
    ... and keep going as long as we can with more and more basic materials!

This could potentially test my fire lighting skills, but I am up for a challenge! It would be nice to be able to find materials on site, but I can bring a range of stuff to anywhere if needed.

## Make anything out of sticks, including the kitchen sink

    Make camp gadgets and furniture from materials in the environment.

    We can make chairs, tables, even a kitchen with a sink from natural wood and a few knots.

I need a good source of material for this, more if they want to keep what they have made (which may have to be incorporated into the price). I am planning to get in touch with a few forestry people to source straight branches between 50 and 100mm diameter cheaply, so watch this space.

## Whittling

    A quiet afternoon carving your very own spoon to keep and use on your next camp!

I think you said you have some knives for this? I would be bringing some fairly easy to carve wood along if it isn't readily available on site. Again, can be done pretty much anywhere if needed.

## Wild baskets and blackberries

    Use locally found materials to make a basket and then find some blackberries to go in it!

Basically weaving brambles, so might be a bit seasonal (and obviously the blackberries are) but I will keep a look out for alternative materials when I visit sites.

## Camp gourmet

    Make a tasty dinner in the woods!

    We will use a camp cooking fire to produce a complete meal, then sit down to enjoy it in the natural environment. Several menu ideas are available and special requests are always a welcome challenge.

This can be done anywhere we can light a fire, so beaches are a good one too if the weather is good. I have a few good receipes that I have done before, but will happily research or invent more as needed.
