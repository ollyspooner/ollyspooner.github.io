Work with teams across the business to understand current end to end processes
and lead in the identification of opportunities for improvement or thinking
that could be hindering customer experience.

## Skills

**Understanding of Change Management and Project Management Practices. Proven track record and experience of managing projects.**

**Understanding of Kaizen projects, Six Sigma and/or other Business Process improvement methods and tools. Understanding of how technology can assist in the improvement of our quality and efficiencies.**

Many of my past projects have been essentially ones of improvement of an existing system. As a system is not only the software, the entire system has to be considered, including the people participating in it. Each process has to be identified and mapped before areas for improvement can be defined. 

When the team was tasked with creating a new donation system I broke the system down into different sections: public front-end/private back-end. These sections were further broken down until we had a set of building blocks to work on improving. I broke the team into pairs and we spent a session producing rough versions of the main user interfaces and architectural elements. These were then reviewed and revised before being demoed to the stakeholders.

I find that mapping (with lists, whiteboards, post-its etc.) a process or potential process with the users and then replaying my understanding of it as a set of diagrams of more formal documents is a good way to ensure that I have understood the requirements. This can be on a large (system architecture) or small scale (individual feature or story).

**A good communicator with excellent fluency in spoken and written English and the ability to explain complex issues in non-technical language.**

**Strong self awareness and self regulation especially under times of pressure.**

**Self motivating with the ability to see projects and tasks through to completion.**

**Ability to hear user experience and desires, translate this to an understanding of the whole system and then articulate a vision of the future state.**

**Analytical skills - requirements gathering, mapping, leading workshops, stakeholder management.**

*Vols App*

Volunteers needed a way to easily keep their personal information up to date, find volunteering opportunities and advertise their availability to deploy.

I worked with the volunteer managing staff to identify and refine the various processes to be managed, such as the volunteer lifecycle. Several out of the box solutions were identified, but as none met our complete requirements, I was tasked with developing a system based on SharePoint, as at the time there was no appetite for a completely bespoke solution. This was reasonably successful but had technical limitations and a risk of becoming degraded as Microsoft changed over to "Modern" pages.
Our purchase of Mendix gave us the opportunity to re-implement and improve the system, as well as include some new requirements as the members of the volunteering team had mostly changed. I again worked with staff to map out processes. I communicated these via a variety of diagrams (e.g. activity, class, use case) back to the staff and together we refined them. I then iteratively produced the system using Mendix.
This system has been continually updated and added to as needs have evolved and changed.

I worked with 2 business analysts on the Ops App to refine requirements and design processes. I am not afraid to make suggestions for improvement if I think they are needed.

**Project skills - Prince2 qualified or a least awareness, project planning, business case writing, project management.**

**Development skills - Agile awareness, experience in agile development projects, ability to review and understand code, ability to act as a product owner, ability to work with IT and developers.**

Since we became a dedicated development team, we have used Agile Scrum or variants of it tailored to the needs of us as developers and those of the business. This has worked well on the whole and, as team lead, I have had to wear many hats (Scrum Master, Developer, Product Owner) depending on the changing size of our team and user engagement and capacity.

I, and my team, have experienced wildly different levels of stakeholder engagement between different projects. This has meant that, in some cases, I have had to do a lot of work understanding requirements by working with end users, effectively owning the product in their behalf. Other projects have multiple potential owners so I have to form a bridge between potentially conflicting needs and priorities.

Last year I passed the Prince2 foundation certification in order to get insight into non-agile techniques, although I feel that some Prince2 principals can also be applied to our current projects to control things like scope creep.

Even in Agile it is still important to be able to justify projects, and so I have written business cases and top level project plans for development projects and also for procurement. One such project was for server procurement:

We had a number of servers due for replacement and we know we wanted to take advantage of virtualisation technology going forward. I wrote a detailed business case and designed a number of solutions balancing a variety of factors including cost, reliability and performance. This gave the organisation the necessary information to make an informed decision and we went ahead with the implementation. The resulting solution performed well, supported our needs and, with individual parts being replaced (Trigger's broom) has only been changed due to our moving most of our systems to cloud services.

**Database skills - SQL knowledge to be able to extract and review data, Access DB development, report design and development.**

A key part of my first role in ShelterBox was to provide reports for Fundraising staff. I would work with them to help define their needs, extract the required data from one or more SQL databases and present it as a spreadsheet. I kept previously written queries were kept on file so that up to date reports could quickly be produced.

**Design skills - knowledge of relational database design, data warehouse design, document logical entity relationship design.**

Designing the way that real world processes and data are stored and represented is an important part of my role. I work closely with my team and stakeholders to ensure that the underlying architecture of our applications is designed such that it can properly represent the data, is performant, resiliant to future changes and also that it is not overly complex. When tasked with writing an integration for our CRM system, I designed a modular framework that took advantage of a lot of inheritance. This meant that the system could easily be extended to implement new features as needed. This library is used in all of our current apps.

**Microsoft skills - knowlege of MS Fabric, Power BI, Power Apps, ability to develop proof of concept applications.**

As an organisation, we have been users of Azure, Power Platform and M365 for some years, and so I have seen this ecosystem grow significantly over the last decade. I have produced tools and integrations using Power Automate (RBS standing orders), PowerShell (lots of utilities for SharePoint, AD/AAD and BBEC) and Azure Functions (Organisation lookup). I have also used Power Apps to create a read only version of our Ops App to allow for continued access to data.
While not the core focus of my current role, I have used Power BI and Power Query (including M script) to aquire and present data.
I have also used enough different systems and frameworks to be able to adapt quickly to take advantage of the best available technologies.

**Software skills - Awareness of a range of ERP, CRM systems and business applications, ability to engage with software suppliers, ability to learn new applications and systems and advise on best practice.**

I have both used, supported and developed against several charity CRM systems, the current one being Blackbaud Enterprise CRM. I also have experience of financial and ERP platforms including Sage and Access Dimensions. As a result of shortcomings in the capability of Access Dimensions to meet the needs of the Supply Chain team, we designed a suite of applications to manage Products, Inventory and Consignments. While Stuart was the lead BA initially, I now fill this role and together with continued good engagement we have continued to grow and improve these apps. A recent change was to overhaul the way transactions were committed to be more resilient to errors.

**Architecture skills - Advise on systems design and integrations, how and when different systems need to communicate, ability to map data between systems, ETL data skills.**

I have a wide experience of different APIs (SOAP, REST, OData etc.) and other storage and transformations technologies that I can call upon to transform data. This also gives me insight into what is needed to ensure efficient and effective integration between different systems.

## Questions

I see that the organisation has merged the 3 separate divisions together. How has or will this actually change the way the organisation works?

What goals do you see for this role? What does success look like?

What are your current main systems and how do they work together?

Regarding transport, what accommodations do you provide for cycling to work?
