## Knots

3 Fishing knots (Angler)
6 Pioneering knots (Pioneering)

* Reef knot – One of the most familiar knots, used to fasten a rope or connect two lengths of rope, but shouldn’t be used under strain as it can come undone.
* Clove hitch – A quick hitch used to start a lashing, the knot can bind or slip and so shouldn’t be relied upon.
* Timber hitch – Usually an alternative to the clove hitch and very easy to tie or tighten. Holds well under strain but doesn’t hold its structure if the tension is loosened.
* Round turn and two half hitches – A good way to secure a rope to a pole. The half hitches on their own are also a good way to tie off loose ends.
* Overhand knot – The overhand knot is a stopper knot when tied in the end of a rope and can be tied with two ends of the same rope to fasten things, but shouldn’t be used alone as it can easily loosen and slip. Used alongside lots of other overhand knots, it can be used to create West Country lashing or whipping.
* Midshipman’s hitch - Can be used to tie adjustable guy lines and is more reliable than some other gripping hitches.

* A diagonal lashing can be used to join two crossing spars at almost any angle when building projects or bracing structures. The diagonal lashing is more versatile than a square lashing, as it can be used on a wider range of angles, while the square lashing is best used just for right angles. Start by tying a timber hitch diagonally over both spars you’re connecting. This allows them to be pulled tight together and tidies the end of the lashing away. Then, wind the running end of the rope around the spars in the same direction as the timber hitch three times. You can add more but make sure there are at least three. After the third turn, wind three more turns, this time crossing your lashing in the other direction over the spars, making a cross shape. Finish the lashing with a clove hitch on the most convenient spar.
* The West Country lashing is a much stronger lashing than the round lashing. It can be used to firmly fix two overlapping spars, as you might when making a flagpole. It’s based on the West Country whipping, which is used to secure the end of a rope to keep it from fraying. Start with an overhand knot. Turn to the other side of the two spars and tie another overhand knot on the opposing side, then pull it tight. Keep tying overhand knots on alternating sides until the lashing is firm. Make sure you tie each overhand knot the same way (right over left and through or left over right and through) for a consistent pattern that keeps the lashing neat and tight.
* The floor lashing can be used to create a tabletop or the floor of a raft without having to individually lash each pole. This method doesn’t require you to feed the whole rope through with each turn, but instead make a bight (loop) in the rope and weave the poles in place. Start the lashing with a timber hitch or a clove hitch on the base spar. Make a bight in the working end (the loose end) and pass it over the first spar on the inside of the base spar. Take the bight and pass it under the base spar to the outside of your platform. Pass the bight over the end of the first spar and pull the working end to tighten your lashing, then repeat for each spar until you reach the end. Finish with two tight half hitches to secure your work.
