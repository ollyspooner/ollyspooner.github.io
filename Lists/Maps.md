## Maps

* Measuring
  * Distance using a ruler (or compass edge)
  * Elevation
  * Using the grid and grid references (up to 6 figure)
* Map features and symbols
* All the norths

## Compasses

* Bearings
  * Get a bearing from a map
  * Follow a bearing while walking

## Naismith's rule

Allow 1 hour per 5km (or 3 miles)
Add 1 hour per 600m (or 2000 feet) of ascent
Add 20 minutes per 600m of steep ascent
Subtract 20 minutes per 600m of gentle descent

## Planning a hike

Plan a route for a hike that will take approximately 2 hours. It should have a sensible start and finish to be dropped off at and picked up from with a vehicle.
How far is the route (in kilometers)?
How long should it take to walk?
Write some simple directions that can be followed without the map.
Write a brief risk assessment for the activity.

## Planning a camping

Plan an overnight camp that starts at 1200 and ends at 1200 the next day. Make an itinerary that includes all the things that need to be done for a comfortable camp, and a few fun activities too.
What kit will be needed?
Make a shopping list.
How much will it cost per scout?
Write a brief risk assessment for the activity.

## 6 Figure grid references

The Ordnance Survey GB (OSGB) Grid system uses a series of subdividing squares to provide better and better precision for a location. The most commonly used type used is a "6 figure" grid reference, which gives us an precision of 100 metres.

4 figure = 1km (Uses 2 digits for eastings and 2 for northings. These are the squares printed on your map)
6 figure = 100m (Uses 2 digits for eastings and 2 for northings. The most commonly used as it is a good balance between precision and the ease of use)
8 figure = 10m (Uses 2 digits for eastings and 2 for northings. use this if you want to be really specific about where you are going)
10 figure = 1m (Uses 2 digits for eastings and 2 for northings. usually given by GPS devices)

The 6 figure grid reference for the Stithians Centre is SW 732 371.

### "The National Grid" (not the electric one!)

The largest grid is usually represented by letters "A" to "Z", with "A" at the north west most point of the grid and "Z" at the south west most point. "I" is not used as it may be mistaken for a number "1". Each square on this grid is 500km by 500km. As squares at the edges are very distorted, in other countries or in the sea, the actual letters used are "H", "N", "S" and "T". "O" covers such a small part of a cliff in North Yorkshire that is often under water. Each of these squares is divided into 25 100km by 100km squares (5 by 5), represented by another letter ("A" to "Z", again missing out "I").

### The grid reference

We probably want to be more specific than identifying a 100km square, so each National Grid square is divided again into 100 10km squares. You can see these on your map as the darker (or heavier) blue grid lines. These squares are each divided again into 100 1km squares, which are the smaller, feinter blue grid on your map. If we wanted to refer to a location in one of these 1 km squares, we could use the numbers printed on the grid, starting with the "easting" (the number printed on the line to the left) and then the "northing" (the number printed on the line on the bottom). As these numbers are 2 digits each, we call the 2 together a "4 figure" reference.

A kilometer is still pretty big, so to get a better location, we can add another digit by measuring with a ruler (there should be a ruler for the scale of your map on the edge of your compass). Simply add the horizontal and vertical measurements (1 digit each) from the bottom left of the square to the end of your eastings and northings to get a "6 figure" reference.
